Hi, I'm Dave. I was a Data Science Intern at [QueBIT](https://quebit.com/), where I worked with a team of consultants and VP of Cross Solutions Architecture to research and implement a new predictive forecasting pipeline that included state of the art neural network approaches (e.g., N-BEATS, DeepAR). Please check out my portfolio or my github for examples of this work.

I am also a PhD student defending my dissertation in July 2023. I then hope to begin a career in data analytics/data science. Please feel free to browse my portfolio here and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/disaltzman/ForecastingProject).

Previously, I was a doctoral student and National Institutes of Health Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Fellow in the [Language and Brain (LAB) Laboratory](https://myerslab.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. My research focused on how humans are able to adeptly understand spoken language, specifically focusing on how they adapt to the novel acoustic-phonetic information they encounter from each new talker.
