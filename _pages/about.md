I am a graduate student and National Institutes of Health Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Fellow in the [Language and Brain (LAB) Laboratory](https://myerslab.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. My research focuses on how humans are able to adeptly understand spoken language, specifically focusing on how they adapt to the novel acoustic-phonetic information they encounter from each new talker.

I am also currently a Data Science Intern at [QueBIT](https://quebit.com/), where I am working to update and improve the forecasting tools they utilize. This includes evaluating new statistical methods like Prophet and neural network approaches like N-BEATS.

I am targeting completion of my dissertation in summer 2023, and hope to begin a career in data science then. Please feel free to browse my public GitHub repositories for examples of my work.
